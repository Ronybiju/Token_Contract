## Introduction of Repository 

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract named MyToken for a custom token called "Code" with the symbol "Super Code." This README file provides an overview of the project, code explanation, deployment instructions, usage guidelines, and the advantages of using this token contract.

## Introduction To Token Contract 

The Tokening contract serves as a basic example of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionalities for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens. This contract can be a foundation for building more complex token-based applications or for learning purposes.

## Code Explanations

Variables tokenName and tokenSymbol define the name and symbol of the token. totalSupply tracks the total supply of tokens. balances is a mapping that keeps track of token balances for each address. Mint Function mint allows the creation of new tokens and assigns them to a specified address. It requires a valid recipient address and increases the total supply. Burn Function burn allows an address to burn (destroy) their tokens. It requires that the sender has enough tokens to burn, and it decreases the total supply.
